# JAVASCRIPT + BOWER + BROWSER GLOBALS

## Description

This is a very lightweight way to package up a module. Instead of uploading your code to [npm](), you push it to a repositoy on github.com and register it with bower. Using "browser globals" refers to neither using CommonJS/AMD/ES6 modules, but using a "non-magic" global JavaScript variable.

Please note: bower is considered with the way you distribute the code, you can also push your code to npm at the same time. Also, it does not make any assumption about your module system, so you could also use CommonJS, AMD or ES6 moules with bower (instead of browser globals as shown in this guide). For a approach to support a lot of different module systems at the same time, see [JAVASCRIPT-JSPM-ES6]!
